# Numerical Experiments in Elasticity and Poroelasticity

This repository contains the source code for the numerical experiments conducted as part of my PhD thesis at the University of Pittsburgh. The code implements MSMFE (Multipoint Stress Mixed Finite Element) methods to solve problems in linear elasticity and MSMFE-MFMFE (Multipoint Stress - Multipoint Flux Mixed Finite Element) methods to solve problems in the Biot system of poroelasticity.

## Supported Grids

- **3D:** Cuboid and hÂ²-parallelepiped grids  
- **2D:** Square, hÂ²-parallelogram, and distorted quadrilateral grids

## Authors

- **Ilona Ambartsumyan**, **Eldar Khattatov** (2016â€“2020)  
- **Ibrahim Yazici** (2023â€“2025)
