# MSMFE_MFMFE_Methods
This repository contains the source code for the numerical experiments conducted as part of my PhD thesis at the University of Pittsburgh. It implements MSMFE (Multipoint Stress Mixed Finite Element) methods for linear elasticity, and MSMFE-MFMFE (Multipoint Stress–Multipoint Flux Mixed Finite Element) methods for the Biot system of poroelasticity, on cuboid and distorted quadrilateral grids.
